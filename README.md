# TC2Log
TC2Log is  a tool that helps track stats about The Crew 2. It does this by reading visual data from the game(pixel colour).
The goal of the project is to create a fully operational tool to help analyse game info, like - Average speed, top speed, time spent between checkpoints and other things.
This project is still work in progress, with many issues and incomplete ideas, as I use this as an excuse to learn new things about programming.

## Usage
The program reads specific pixels at specific coordinates, so the game resolution must be 1080x1920 resolution.
